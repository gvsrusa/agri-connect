# AgriConnect Research Scope Definition

## Project Context
This research supports the development of the AgriConnect web application, as defined in the provided SPARC Blueprint (PRD). AgriConnect aims to empower small and marginal Indian farmers through a multi-lingual web platform offering a marketplace, price discovery, crop advisory, and transport connection features.

## Research Objectives
The primary goal is to assess the viability and inform the initial development strategy for AgriConnect by investigating five key areas:

1.  **Feasibility Assessment:** Evaluate the overall practicality of the project considering the target user base (small/marginal farmers, varying tech literacy, potential low bandwidth environments) and the core feature set (marketplace, price discovery, advisory, multi-language support).
2.  **Technology Stack Validation:** Analyze the suitability of the proposed technology stack (Next.js, Supabase, Clerk/NextAuth, Tailwind CSS) against the project's requirements, focusing on performance, scalability, ease of multi-language implementation, offline capabilities (even if limited), and accessibility for the target users.
3.  **Multi-Language Implementation Strategy:** Research best practices, specific libraries/tools, potential challenges, and recommended workflows for implementing multi-language support (Hindi, Marathi, English, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi initially) within a Next.js application using Supabase for data and Tailwind CSS for styling. This includes UI text management, content translation processes, and language switching mechanisms.
4.  **Data Sourcing Strategy:** Identify potential methods, specific sources (e.g., government APIs, private data providers, community sourcing), and management strategies for acquiring and maintaining:
    *   Real-time or frequently updated local agricultural market price data.
    *   Localized, actionable crop advisory and post-harvest management content suitable for the target audience and available in multiple languages.
5.  **Risk and Challenge Identification:** Proactively identify and highlight major potential risks and challenges based on the PRD and the nature of the project (e.g., data accuracy and timeliness, user adoption barriers, maintaining UI/UX simplicity across languages, ensuring accessibility, managing content translation at scale).

## Out of Scope for Initial Research
*   Detailed financial modeling or cost analysis.
*   Deep dives into specific algorithms for future features (e.g., AI advisory).
*   Legal/regulatory compliance analysis beyond data privacy mentioned in the PRD.
*   Hardware infrastructure planning beyond the specified cloud services (Supabase, Clerk).
*   Detailed UI/UX design mockups.

## Deliverables
The research findings will be documented within a structured directory (`research/`) containing detailed analysis, synthesized insights, and a final report, adhering to file size constraints and utilizing Perplexity AI for information gathering.
