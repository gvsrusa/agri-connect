# AgriConnect Key Research Questions

These questions guide the research process, derived from the project objectives and the AgriConnect SPARC Blueprint.

## 1. Feasibility Assessment
*   What are the documented digital literacy levels and common technology access patterns (device types, internet quality) among small and marginal farmers in the target regions of India (initially covering Hindi, Marathi, English, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi speaking areas)?
*   How significant is the challenge of low/intermittent bandwidth for web application usability in these rural areas? What are common coping mechanisms or existing solutions?
*   Are there existing studies or data on the adoption rates and usability challenges of similar agricultural web/mobile applications among this target demographic?
*   How receptive are farmers in these regions likely to be to a web-based marketplace and information portal versus traditional methods? What are potential trust barriers?
*   Considering the need for simplicity and accessibility, how complex can the core features (marketplace listing, price lookup, advisory browsing) realistically be while remaining usable for the target audience?

## 2. Technology Stack Validation
*   How does Next.js perform in low-bandwidth conditions, particularly regarding initial load times and subsequent navigation? What specific Next.js features (e.g., ISR, SSR, SSG, App Router vs Pages Router) are best suited for optimizing performance in this context?
*   What are the known scalability limits or potential bottlenecks of Supabase (PostgreSQL) when handling a growing user base and increasing data volume (listings, price data, content)?
*   How well do Clerk and NextAuth handle authentication methods common in India (e.g., phone number OTP) and perform under potentially unreliable network conditions? Are there specific considerations for user session management?
*   Does Tailwind CSS introduce significant performance overhead compared to other CSS strategies, especially on lower-end devices? How does it interact with dynamic content loading and language changes?
*   What are the practical limitations and implementation strategies for achieving *limited* offline functionality (e.g., caching advisory content) using Next.js and potentially service workers or PWA features, considering the MVP scope avoids a full PWA?

## 3. Multi-Language Implementation
*   What are the standard libraries and best practices for internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) within the Next.js ecosystem (e.g., `next-intl`, `react-i18next`, native App Router i18n)? How do they compare in terms of ease of use, performance, and features (like pluralization, date/number formatting)?
*   How can UI text (labels, buttons, messages) be effectively managed across 8+ languages? What are common workflows for translation management (e.g., using JSON files, dedicated translation management systems)?
*   How should dynamic content stored in Supabase (e.g., crop advisory articles, market names) be structured to support multiple languages efficiently? What are the query performance implications?
*   What are the best practices for implementing a user-friendly language switcher in a Next.js app using Tailwind CSS, ensuring it's easily accessible and updates the UI/content correctly?
*   What are the specific UI/UX challenges when designing for multiple Indian languages (e.g., text expansion/contraction, font rendering, right-to-left support if needed later)? How does Tailwind CSS handle these challenges?

## 4. Data Sourcing Strategy
*   What publicly available government sources (e.g., AGMARKNET, state agricultural marketing boards) provide reliable, localized, and frequently updated agricultural commodity price data for the target regions? What are the formats, update frequencies, and API availability?
*   Are there private data providers specializing in Indian agricultural market intelligence? What are their typical offerings, costs, and data quality guarantees?
*   What are viable strategies for sourcing or creating localized crop advisory and post-harvest management content relevant to smallholders in the target regions and languages? (e.g., partnerships with agricultural universities/NGOs, adapting government extension materials, expert curation)?
*   How can the accuracy and timeliness of sourced market price data be validated and maintained?
*   What methods can be used to ensure sourced advisory content is accurate, actionable, and culturally appropriate for the diverse target farmer groups? How can this content be effectively translated and kept up-to-date across languages?

## 5. Risk and Challenge Identification
*   What are the primary risks associated with ensuring the accuracy and timeliness of market price data, and what are the potential impacts on farmer trust and adoption?
*   What are the key challenges in driving adoption among farmers with low digital literacy or skepticism towards new technology?
*   How can the application maintain simplicity and ease of use across multiple languages and diverse user needs?
*   What are the operational challenges in managing content translation and updates across 8+ languages efficiently and accurately?
*   Are there potential data privacy risks beyond basic contact info, considering location data might be inferred or collected?
*   What is the risk of the platform being misused (e.g., inaccurate listings, unreliable transporters)?
