# Feature Overview Specification: Resolve Unresolved TODO Tests for Full Coverage

**1. Introduction**
This document outlines the specification for the feature "Resolve Unresolved TODO Tests for Full Coverage". The primary goal is to address and implement 17 pending 'todo' tests within the AgriConnect 'main_codebase'. Successfully completing these tests will significantly improve overall test coverage, leading to enhanced system stability and reliability. This initiative is tracked by Pheromone Signal: `task-coverage-unresolvedtodotests-2025-05-13T18-06-14-000Z`.
**Update (2025-05-13):** Subsequent review confirmed that the 17 'todo' tests, primarily located in `__tests__/features/auth/auth.test.tsx`, were already implemented or had been appropriately marked as skipped in the existing codebase. Therefore, no new test implementation was required for this item.

**2. User Stories**
*   **As a Developer,** I want all 'todo' tests to be implemented and passing, so that I can have higher confidence in the stability of the codebase and catch regressions early.
*   **As a QA Engineer,** I want comprehensive test coverage, including the resolution of all 'todo' tests, so that I can ensure the application meets quality standards before release.
*   **As a Project Manager,** I want all 'todo' tests resolved, so that we can reduce technical debt and improve the maintainability of the AgriConnect platform.

**3. Acceptance Criteria**
*   All 17 identified 'todo' tests in the 'main_codebase' are implemented with meaningful assertions.
*   Each implemented test successfully passes in the CI/CD pipeline.
*   The purpose and functionality covered by each resolved 'todo' test are clearly understood and documented if necessary (e.g., via clear test descriptions).
*   Test coverage metrics show an improvement corresponding to the resolution of these tests.
*   The implemented tests verify specific functionalities as originally intended by the 'todo' placeholders.

**4. Functional Requirements**
*   **FR1: Identification:** All 17 'todo' tests within the 'main_codebase' must be accurately identified and cataloged.
*   **FR2: Comprehension:** The intended functionality or scenario that each 'todo' test was designed to cover must be thoroughly understood. This may involve code analysis, consulting existing documentation, or conferring with team members familiar with the respective modules.
*   **FR3: Implementation:** Each 'todo' test must be implemented with appropriate test logic, including setup, execution, and assertions.
*   **FR4: Validation:** Implemented tests must correctly validate the intended behavior of the code under test.
*   **FR5: Passing State:** All implemented tests must pass consistently in local and CI environments.

**5. Non-Functional Requirements**
*   **NFR1: Maintainability:** Implemented tests should be well-structured, clearly written, and easy to understand and maintain.
*   **NFR2: Performance:** Tests should execute efficiently and not unduly prolong the overall test suite execution time.
*   **NFR3: Isolation:** Tests should be independent and not rely on the state or outcome of other tests.
*   **NFR4: Readability:** Test code should follow established coding conventions and be easily readable.

**6. Scope**
    *   **In Scope:**
        *   Locating and listing all 17 'todo' tests across the 'main_codebase'.
        *   Analyzing the context of each 'todo' test to understand its original intent.
        *   Defining specific acceptance criteria for what constitutes a "resolved" 'todo' test (i.e., it becomes a meaningful, passing test).
        *   Writing and implementing the test logic for each of the 17 'todo' tests.
        *   Ensuring all newly implemented tests pass and integrate into the existing test suite.
        *   Updating test coverage reports.
    *   **Out of Scope:**
        *   Implementing new features not related to the 'todo' tests.
        *   Refactoring code that is not directly under test by the 'todo' items, unless strictly necessary for the test to function.
        *   Addressing bugs or issues in the codebase that are unrelated to the functionality intended to be covered by the 'todo' tests.
        *   Major architectural changes to the testing framework itself.

**7. Dependencies**
*   Access to the AgriConnect 'main_codebase'.
*   Understanding of the existing testing framework and tools (e.g., Jest, Testing Library).
*   Potentially, access to original developers or documentation that might shed light on the intent of some 'todo' tests.
*   CI/CD pipeline for test execution and validation.

**8. High-Level UI/UX Considerations or API Design Notes**
*   Not Applicable for this feature, as it primarily concerns backend test code implementation.
