**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-05-12
**Author:** Roo (Spec Writer AI)
**Feature Name:** Crop Advisory Content Delivery

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the specifications for the "Crop Advisory Content Delivery" feature within the AgriConnect application. The primary goal of this feature is to provide Indian farmers with concise, actionable advice on common pests, diseases, and climate-related farming impacts. Content will be presented on easy-to-read web pages in the user's selected language, catering to users with varying literacy levels. This feature aims to empower farmers with timely and relevant information to improve crop yield, manage risks, and enhance their agricultural practices.

## 2. User Stories

-   **US1:** As a farmer, I want to easily find and read advice about common crop pests in my local language, so I can take timely action to protect my crops.
-   **US2:** As a farmer, I want to access information on how to manage crop diseases, presented with simple text and intuitive icons, so I can understand it easily even if my literacy is low.
-   **US3:** As a farmer, I want to get climate-related farming advice relevant to my crops and region, so I can adapt my farming practices effectively.
-   **US4:** As a farmer, I want all advisory content to be available in my preferred language (selected in my profile), so I can fully comprehend the guidance provided.
-   **US5:** As a farmer with intermittent internet access, I want to be able to view previously accessed advisory content offline, so I can refer to it in the field when needed.
-   **US6:** As a farmer, I want to see advisory topic titles in my selected language so I can easily identify relevant information.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

-   **AC1:** When a user selects a crop advisory topic, the system MUST display relevant, concise tips and information related to that topic. (Ref: PRD 19)
-   **AC2:** Advisory content (text, and links to simple images/media) MUST be presented on easy-to-read web pages. (Ref: PRD 19, 30)
-   **AC3:** All advisory content (topic titles, detailed advice) MUST be displayed in the user's selected language, as configured in their user profile. (Ref: PRD 19, 62)
-   **AC4:** The user interface for accessing and viewing advisories MUST use minimal text and intuitive icons to aid understanding for low-literacy users. (Ref: PRD 48)
-   **AC5:** The system MUST be able to store and retrieve advisory content for multiple supported languages from the Supabase PostgreSQL database. (Ref: PRD 36)
-   **AC6:** Previously viewed advisory content (for the last selected language) MUST be cached on the client-side for limited offline access. (Ref: PRD 37)
-   **AC7:** Navigation to and within the crop advisory section MUST be clear, straightforward, and intuitive.
-   **AC8:** Advisory topic titles displayed in lists or navigation MUST be shown in the user's selected language. (Ref: PRD 62)

## 4. Functional Requirements

### FR1: Content Management (Assumed Admin Interface or Direct Supabase Management)
-   **FR1.1:** The system MUST allow for the creation, update, and deletion of advisory topics.
-   **FR1.2:** The system MUST allow for adding, updating, and deleting advisory content items (text, simple media URLs) associated with each topic.
-   **FR1.3:** Each advisory topic title and content item MUST support multiple language versions.

### FR2: Content Display (User-Facing)
-   **FR2.1:** The system MUST display a list of available advisory topics to the user.
-   **FR2.2:** The system MUST allow users to select an advisory topic to view its detailed content.
-   **FR2.3:** The system MUST retrieve and display advisory content (topic title, details) corresponding to the selected topic and the user's preferred language.
-   **FR2.4:** Content display MUST be optimized for readability (e.g., clear fonts, appropriate text size, sufficient spacing, short paragraphs/bullets).
-   **FR2.5:** The system SHOULD support the display of simple media (e.g., images, icons referenced by URL) alongside text content where applicable.

### FR3: Language Handling
-   **FR3.1:** The system MUST use the user's language preference (from their profile) to determine the language for displaying advisory content and related UI elements.
-   **FR3.2:** If content is not available in the user's preferred language, a sensible fallback (e.g., default language or a message) SHOULD be implemented (though PRD implies availability).

### FR4: Offline Access
-   **FR4.1:** The system MUST cache advisory content (text and media URLs for the current language) on the client-side when a user views it.
-   **FR4.2:** The system MUST allow users to view this cached content when the application is offline.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

-   **NFR1: Accessibility:** The UI MUST be designed to be accessible to low-literacy and low-tech users, incorporating minimal text, intuitive icons, and responsive design. Adherence to WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines for key interactions is targeted. (Ref: PRD 48)
-   **NFR2: Performance:** Advisory content pages MUST load quickly (target < 3 seconds on a 3G connection). Client-side rendering and caching strategies should be employed.
-   **NFR3: Scalability:** The database structure and backend services MUST be designed to handle a growing library of advisory content, an increasing number of users, and additional languages without significant performance degradation.
-   **NFR4: Maintainability:** Code and content structures MUST be well-organized, documented, and easy to maintain or update by developers and content managers.
-   **NFR5: Localization:** All UI text elements specific to this feature (beyond the advisory content itself, e.g., section titles, buttons) MUST be localizable using the application's existing localization infrastructure. (Ref: PRD 35)
-   **NFR6: Data Integrity:** The system MUST ensure that the correct language version of content is consistently served based on user preference.
-   **NFR7: Responsiveness:** The feature MUST be fully responsive and usable across various devices, including mobile phones and tablets. (Ref: PRD 48)

## 6. Scope

## 8. Data Model (Supabase - High-Level Proposal)

This model aims to support structured storage for multiple language versions efficiently.

### `languages`
-   `code` (TEXT, PK, e.g., 'en', 'hi', 'ta') - ISO 639-1 code
-   `name` (TEXT, NOT NULL, e.g., 'English', 'हिन्दी', 'தமிழ்')

### `advisory_topics`
-   `id` (UUID, PK, default: `uuid_generate_v4()`)
-   `slug` (TEXT, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, e.g., 'pest-management-rice') - for SEO-friendly URLs
-   `icon_url` (TEXT, nullable) - URL to an icon representing the topic
-   `created_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ, default: `now()`)
-   `updated_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ, default: `now()`)

### `advisory_topic_translations`
-   `topic_id` (UUID, FK to `advisory_topics.id`, ON DELETE CASCADE)
-   `language_code` (TEXT, FK to `languages.code`, ON DELETE CASCADE)
-   `title` (TEXT, NOT NULL, e.g., "Pest Management for Rice")
-   `short_description` (TEXT, nullable) - Brief overview for topic lists
-   PRIMARY KEY (`topic_id`, `language_code`)

### `advisory_content_items`
-   `id` (UUID, PK, default: `uuid_generate_v4()`)
-   `topic_id` (UUID, FK to `advisory_topics.id`, ON DELETE CASCADE)
-   `item_type` (TEXT, NOT NULL, e.g., 'heading', 'paragraph', 'image_url', 'list_item') - To allow structured content
-   `order_index` (SMALLINT, NOT NULL, default: 0) - For sequencing content within a topic
-   `created_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ, default: `now()`)
-   `updated_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ, default: `now()`)

### `advisory_content_translations`
-   `content_item_id` (UUID, FK to `advisory_content_items.id`, ON DELETE CASCADE)
-   `language_code` (TEXT, FK to `languages.code`, ON DELETE CASCADE)
-   `text_content` (TEXT, nullable) - The actual advisory tip text, or image caption
-   `media_url` (TEXT, nullable) - URL for images or simple media
-   PRIMARY KEY (`content_item_id`, `language_code`)

**Rationale:**
-   Separates topic definition from its translations.
-   Separates content structure (`advisory_content_items`) from its translated text/media (`advisory_content_translations`).
-   `item_type` and `order_index` in `advisory_content_items` allow for richer, ordered content within a single advisory page (e.g., a heading, followed by paragraphs, an image, then more paragraphs).
-   Using `language_code` as FK ensures consistency.

## 9. User Flow

1.  **Login & Language Set:** User logs into AgriConnect. Their preferred language is already set in their profile.
2.  **Navigate to Advisories:** User selects "Crop Advisories" (or similarly named, localized item) from the main navigation menu.
3.  **View Topic List:** The system displays a list of available advisory topics.
    -   Each topic title is shown in the user's selected language (e.g., "टमाटर में कीट नियंत्रण" if Hindi is selected).
    -   Intuitive icons may accompany each topic title.
4.  **Select Topic:** User taps or clicks on a desired topic (e.g., "टमाटर में कीट नियंत्रण").
5.  **View Advisory Content:** The system displays the detailed advisory content for the selected topic.
    -   All content (headings, paragraphs, image captions) is presented in the user's selected language.
    -   Content is structured for easy reading (e.g., short sentences, bullet points, relevant images/icons).
    -   If content is paginated or scrollable, navigation is clear.
6.  **Navigate Away:** User can navigate back to the topic list or to other sections of the application using standard navigation controls.
7.  **Offline Access Scenario:**
    -   If the user has previously viewed "टमाटर में कीट नियंत्रण" and is now offline:
    -   When they navigate to and select this topic, the application attempts to load it from the client-side cache.
    -   If found in cache, the content is displayed (last viewed version in Hindi).
    -   If not in cache (or cache fails), an appropriate offline message is displayed.

## 10. Multi-Language Handling

-   **User Preference:** The user's language preference is sourced from their authenticated user profile (dependency D1).
-   **Content Retrieval:**
    -   Backend APIs fetching advisory topics and content items will join with the respective translation tables (`advisory_topic_translations`, `advisory_content_translations`) using the user's `language_code`.
    -   Example (Conceptual SQL):
        ```sql
        SELECT att.title, act.text_content, act.media_url
        FROM advisory_topics at
        JOIN advisory_topic_translations att ON at.id = att.topic_id
        JOIN advisory_content_items aci ON at.id = aci.topic_id
        JOIN advisory_content_translations act ON aci.id = act.content_item_id
        WHERE at.slug = 'selected-topic-slug'
          AND att.language_code = 'user-language-code'
          AND act.language_code = 'user-language-code'
        ORDER BY aci.order_index;
        ```
-   **Fallback Strategy:** If a translation for a specific content item or topic title is missing in the user's preferred language, the system should ideally fall back to a default language (e.g., English) or clearly indicate that the translation is unavailable. The PRD (62) implies content will be available, so missing translations should be an edge case addressed during content population.
-   **UI Localization:** All static UI elements (buttons, labels, section headers) within the feature will be localized using the application's global localization system (dependency D2). (Ref: PRD 35)

## 11. Offline Considerations (Caching)

-   **Caching Mechanism:** When a user successfully loads and views an advisory topic's content, the fetched data (text, media URLs for the current language) will be stored in the client's browser storage (e.g., LocalStorage, IndexedDB, or via a service worker).
-   **Cache Key:** A composite key including `topic_id` (or `topic_slug`) and `language_code` will be used to store and retrieve cached content, ensuring language-specific caching.
-   **Cache Scope:** Caching is limited to content explicitly viewed by the user. No pre-emptive caching of all advisories is planned for this iteration.
-   **Cache Invalidation/Update:** A simple strategy will be employed initially (e.g., cache expires after a set period, or content is re-fetched if online and a newer version is available – versioning might be needed in `advisory_content_items` or `advisory_topics` via `updated_at` for this). For simplicity, the initial focus is on displaying cached data if offline.
-   **User Experience:** When offline, if cached data is available, it's displayed. If not, a clear message informs the user they are offline and the content isn't available. (Ref: PRD 37)

## 12. UI/UX Considerations

-   **Simplicity & Clarity:**
    -   Prioritize minimal text on navigation screens. Use clear, universally understood icons extensively. (Ref: PRD 48)
    -   Content pages should present information in short, digestible chunks (paragraphs, bullet points).
-   **Readability:**
    -   Use large, legible fonts suitable for diverse literacy levels.
    -   Ensure high contrast between text and background.
-   **Navigation:**
    -   A clear, easily accessible entry point to the "Crop Advisory" section from the main application navigation.
    -   Topic lists should be easy to scan. Topic titles should be prominent.
    -   Visual cues for selected items or current location.
    -   Consistent and predictable back navigation.
-   **Visual Aids:**
    -   Incorporate simple, relevant images or icons within the advisory content itself to support understanding, especially for complex topics or instructions.
    -   Visuals should be optimized for fast loading.
-   **Language Prominence:**
    -   The application should clearly operate in the user's selected language. There should be no ambiguity.
-   **Responsiveness:**
    -   The entire feature must be fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops. (Ref: PRD 48)
-   **Feedback & Error Handling:**
    -   Provide visual feedback during data loading (e.g., spinners).
    -   Display user-friendly error messages if content fails to load (and not available in cache) or if an operation fails.
    -   Clearly indicate offline status and whether content is being served from cache.
-   **Accessibility:**
    -   Ensure interactive elements are easily tappable/clickable.
    -   Consider ARIA attributes for screen reader compatibility where appropriate.
