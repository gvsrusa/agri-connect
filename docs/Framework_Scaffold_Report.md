# Agri-Connect - Framework Scaffolding Report

## 1. Overview

This document summarizes the automated framework scaffolding activities performed for the Agri-Connect project, based on the requirements outlined in the [`docs/Master_Project_Plan.md`](docs/Master_Project_Plan.md). The goal was to establish the foundational structure, configurations, and testing infrastructure necessary for subsequent feature development.

## 2. Scaffolding Activities

The following tasks were delegated and completed by specialized agents:

### 2.1. DevOps Foundations Setup (`@DevOps_Foundations_Setup`)

*   **Objective:** Establish basic project organization and CI/CD readiness.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Created standard Next.js directory structure (`app`, `components`, `lib`, `public`, `styles`).
    *   Created a basic GitHub Actions workflow stub for CI at [`.github/workflows/main.yml`](.github/workflows/main.yml).
    *   Verified the existing [`.gitignore`](/.gitignore) file for suitability with a Next.js project.
*   **Outcome:** Foundational project setup aspects established; basic automated build pipeline stub initiated.

### 2.2. Framework Boilerplate Generation (`@Coder_Framework_Boilerplate`)

*   **Objective:** Create the initial application code structure using the specified technology stack.
*   **Technology Stack:** Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, `next-intl`.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Initialized the Next.js project.
    *   Installed and configured Tailwind CSS ([`tailwind.config.ts`](tailwind.config.ts), [`postcss.config.mjs`](postcss.config.mjs), [`styles/globals.css`](styles/globals.css)).
    *   Installed and configured `next-intl` for internationalization ([`i18n.ts`](i18n.ts), [`middleware.ts`](middleware.ts), [`messages/`](messages/)).
    *   Created core configuration files ([`package.json`](package.json), [`next.config.mjs`](next.config.mjs), [`tsconfig.json`](tsconfig.json)).
    *   Generated basic application layout and page structure ([`app/layout.tsx`](app/layout.tsx), [`app/[locale]/layout.tsx`](app/[locale]/layout.tsx), [`app/[locale]/page.tsx`](app/[locale]/page.tsx)).
*   **Outcome:** Core application boilerplate generated, integrating the chosen frontend framework, styling solution, and internationalization library. Directory structure defined.

### 2.3. Test Harness Setup (`@Tester_TDD_Master`)

*   **Objective:** Establish the testing infrastructure to support Test-Driven Development (TDD).
*   **Technology Stack:** Jest, React Testing Library.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Installed necessary testing dependencies.
    *   Configured Jest for the Next.js environment ([`jest.config.mjs`](jest.config.mjs), [`jest.setup.js`](jest.setup.js)).
    *   Created mock files for static assets ([`__mocks__/`](__mocks/)).
    *   Added a `test` script to [`package.json`](package.json).
    *   Created placeholder test files (stubs) in [`__tests__/features/`](__tests__/features) for major project features (Authentication, Marketplace, Crop Advisory, Post-Harvest Guidance, Transportation, Language Switching).
*   **Outcome:** Testing infrastructure established, configured, and verified. Initial test stubs created, enabling continuous integration readiness and facilitating future TDD workflows.

## 3. Current Project State

The Agri-Connect project now has a foundational framework scaffold in place. This includes:

*   A defined project structure.
*   Core dependencies installed ([`package.json`](package.json)). Note: `npm install` needs to be run.
*   Basic CI configuration.
*   Integrated styling (Tailwind CSS).
*   Integrated internationalization (`next-intl`).
*   A configured testing environment (Jest & React Testing Library) with initial test stubs.

The project is now ready for the next phase: feature-specific development and test plan creation.
