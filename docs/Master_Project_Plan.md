# AgriConnect - Master Project Plan (Initialization Phase Output)

## 1. Introduction

This document summarizes the initial planning phase for the AgriConnect project, a web application designed to empower small and marginal Indian farmers with essential tools and information (marketplace, price discovery, crop/harvest advice, transport connections) accessible in multiple local languages. This plan is derived from the initial blueprint ([`docs/PRD`](docs/PRD)) and the outputs of subsequent research, feature specification, and high-level architectural design tasks.

## 2. Technology Stack

The core technology stack selected for this project is:
*   **Frontend Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
*   **Backend API:** Next.js (API Routes / Server Actions)
*   **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
*   **Authentication:** Clerk (via Next.js SDK) / Potentially NextAuth (as per PRD - Clerk preferred based on common usage patterns with Next.js/Supabase)
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*   **Internationalization (i18n):** `next-intl` (Recommended in Language Switching architecture)

## 3. Core Features & Modules (Defined in Initialization)

The following core features have undergone initial specification and high-level architectural definition:

*   **Authentication & User Profile Management:**
    *   Specification: [`docs/specs/Authentication_UserProfile_Management_overview.md`](docs/specs/Authentication_UserProfile_Management_overview.md)
    *   Architecture: [`docs/architecture/Authentication_UserProfile_Management_architecture.md`](docs/architecture/Authentication_UserProfile_Management_architecture.md)
*   **Marketplace & Price Discovery:**
    *   Specification: [`docs/specs/Marketplace_Price_Discovery_overview.md`](docs/specs/Marketplace_Price_Discovery_overview.md)
    *   Architecture: [`docs/architecture/Marketplace_Price_Discovery_architecture.md`](docs/architecture/Marketplace_Price_Discovery_architecture.md)
*   **Crop Advisory Content Delivery:**
    *   Specification: [`docs/specs/Crop_Advisory_Content_Delivery_overview.md`](docs/specs/Crop_Advisory_Content_Delivery_overview.md)
    *   Architecture: [`docs/architecture/Crop_Advisory_Content_Delivery_architecture.md`](docs/architecture/Crop_Advisory_Content_Delivery_architecture.md)
*   **Post-Harvest Guidance Delivery:**
    *   Specification: [`docs/specs/Post-Harvest_Guidance_Delivery_overview.md`](docs/specs/Post-Harvest_Guidance_Delivery_overview.md)
    *   Architecture: [`docs/architecture/Post-Harvest_Guidance_Delivery_architecture.md`](docs/architecture/Post-Harvest_Guidance_Delivery_architecture.md)
*   **Transportation Connection:**
    *   Specification: [`docs/specs/Transportation_Connection_overview.md`](docs/specs/Transportation_Connection_overview.md)
    *   Architecture: [`docs/architecture/Transportation_Connection_architecture.md`](docs/architecture/Transportation_Connection_architecture.md)
*   **Language Switching Mechanism:**
    *   Specification: [`docs/specs/Language_Switching_Mechanism_overview.md`](docs/specs/Language_Switching_Mechanism_overview.md)
    *   Architecture: [`docs/architecture/Language_Switching_Mechanism_architecture.md`](docs/architecture/Language_Switching_Mechanism_architecture.md)

## 4. Key Findings & Considerations (Initial Research)

Initial research ([`research/`](research/)) highlighted:
*   **Feasibility:** The project is feasible but requires careful execution.
*   **Accessibility:** Designing for low-literacy users and low-bandwidth conditions is critical.
*   **Localization:** Robust multi-language support (UI and content) is essential and complex.
*   **Data Sourcing:** Reliable sources for localized market prices and advisory content need to be secured.
*   **Risks:** User adoption, data accuracy, and operational complexity are key risks.
*   **Knowledge Gaps:** Further research needed on granular user data, specific data source APIs, and operational costs ([`research/03_analysis/03_knowledge_gaps.md`](research/03_analysis/03_knowledge_gaps.md)).

## 5. High-Level Roadmap & Next Steps

This initialization phase (blueprint analysis, feasibility study, feature decomposition, high-level design) is complete. The next logical steps include:

1.  **Framework Scaffolding:** Setting up the basic Next.js project structure, installing dependencies (including `next-intl`), configuring Supabase integration, and establishing basic CI/CD.
2.  **Module Implementation (Iterative):** Begin detailed design and implementation of the architected modules, likely starting with Authentication/User Profile and Language Switching as foundational elements.
3.  **Test Planning & Specification:** Develop detailed test plans for each module based on the specifications.
4.  **Data Source Integration:** Finalize and integrate the external source for market price data.
5.  **Content Population:** Develop a strategy and process for creating/translating and managing advisory and guidance content in Supabase.
6.  **Address Knowledge Gaps:** Conduct further targeted research as needed.

## 6. Dependencies

*   **External Services:** Clerk/NextAuth, Supabase, Market Price Data Source (TBD).
*   **Internal Modules:** Significant interdependencies exist, particularly reliance on the Authentication/User Profile module by most other features for user context and language preference. Content delivery modules share similar architectural patterns.
