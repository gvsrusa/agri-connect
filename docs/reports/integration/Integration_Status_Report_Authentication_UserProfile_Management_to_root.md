# Integration Status Report

**Feature:** Authentication & User Profile Management
**Source Path:** N/A (Files developed in place within the main codebase)
**Target Path:** `/workspaces/agri-connect` (Project Root)
**Integration Strategy:** N/A (In-place development)
**Timestamp:** 2025-05-12T16:54:38Z

## Summary

This report documents the verification of files associated with the 'Authentication & User Profile Management' feature. The development occurred directly within the target codebase, so no file copying or explicit source code consolidation from a separate directory was performed. The primary goal was to verify the presence and location of the feature's constituent files as recorded during development completion.

## Verification Steps

1.  **Identify Feature Files:** Files associated with the feature were identified from project signals ([`.pheromone`](./.pheromone)).
2.  **Verify File Existence:** Checked the existence of each identified file within the target path (`/workspaces/agri-connect`).

## Verified Files

The following files related to the feature were confirmed to exist at their specified paths:

*   [`types/userProfile.ts`](./types/userProfile.ts)
*   [`lib/userProfile.ts`](./lib/userProfile.ts)
*   [`app/api/user-profile/route.ts`](./app/api/user-profile/route.ts)
*   [`components/profile/UserProfileForm.tsx`](./components/profile/UserProfileForm.tsx)
*   [`components/profile/UserProfileFormWrapper.tsx`](./components/profile/UserProfileFormWrapper.tsx)
*   [`app/[locale]/profile/page.tsx`](./app/[locale]/profile/page.tsx)
*   [`__tests__/features/auth/auth.test.tsx`](./__tests__/features/auth/auth.test.tsx)
*   [`__tests__/components/profile/UserProfileForm.test.tsx`](./__tests__/components/profile/UserProfileForm.test.tsx)

## Conflicts / Overwrites

No file system operations involving copying or overwriting were performed, as the feature was developed in place. Therefore, no conflicts or overwrites in the traditional integration sense occurred. The verified files represent the state committed post-development.

## Status

**Successful**

The verification confirms that all expected files for the 'Authentication & User Profile Management' feature are present in the codebase.
