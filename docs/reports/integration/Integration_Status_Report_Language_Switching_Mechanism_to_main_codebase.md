# Integration Status Report: Language Switching Mechanism

**Date:** May 12, 2025
**Feature:** Language Switching Mechanism
**Source:** Specified list of files within the project structure.
**Target:** `main_codebase` (Project Root: `/Users/gvsrusa/PWA/agri-connect`)
**Integration Strategy:** Verify presence and report status (Implicit 'report_conflicts').

## Summary

This report details the integration verification for the "Language Switching Mechanism" feature. The integration involved confirming the presence of specific files within the main codebase, rather than copying from a separate source directory. All specified files were found at their expected locations. A potential overlap was noted for one file as per input signals.

## Verification Steps

1.  **Project Root:** `/Users/gvsrusa/PWA/agri-connect`
2.  **Target Path:** `.` (Project Root) - Verified Exists.
3.  **Source Files Verification:** The following files, constituting the feature, were checked for existence at their specified paths within the target codebase:
    *   [`components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx`](components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx:1): Found
    *   [`i18n.ts`](i18n.ts:1): Found
    *   [`middleware.ts`](middleware.ts:1): Found
    *   [`messages/en.json`](messages/en.json): Found
    *   [`messages/hi.json`](messages/hi.json): Found
    *   [`messages/mr.json`](messages/mr.json): Found
    *   [`messages/te.json`](messages/te.json): Found
    *   [`messages/ta.json`](messages/ta.json): Found
    *   [`messages/kn.json`](messages/kn.json): Found
    *   [`messages/ml.json`](messages/ml.json): Found
    *   [`messages/pa.json`](messages/pa.json): Found
    *   [`app/api/user-profile/route.ts`](app/api/user-profile/route.ts:1): Found (Potential overlap noted)
    *   [`jest.setup.js`](jest.setup.js:1): Found
    *   [`jest.config.mjs`](jest.config.mjs:1): Found
    *   [`__tests__/components/LanguageSwitcher.test.tsx`](__tests__/components/LanguageSwitcher.test.tsx:1): Found

## Integration Outcome

*   **Files Verified:** All 15 specified files were successfully located within the main codebase.
*   **Files Copied:** 0 (Integration involved verification, not copying).
*   **Files Overwritten:** 0
*   **Files Skipped:** 0
*   **Conflicts/Issues:**
    *   The file [`app/api/user-profile/route.ts`](app/api/user-profile/route.ts:1) was identified as having a potential overlap based on input signal `integration-lang-switch-ready-20250512T214829Z` ([`.pheromone:379`](.pheromone:379)). Further review or merging might be required for this specific file, although it exists in the target location.

## Final Status

**Integration Verification Successful:** All specified files for the "Language Switching Mechanism" feature are present in the `main_codebase`. The potential conflict noted for [`app/api/user-profile/route.ts`](app/api/user-profile/route.ts:1) should be addressed separately if necessary.
